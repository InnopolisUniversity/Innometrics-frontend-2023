# Innometrics Frontend
Track, evaluate and analyze the software development process. This system provides a visualisation of users' working activity statistics. An intelligent, customizable dashboard to visualize and manipulate software engineering data based on requirements and preferences coming from the industry.
Stores information from:

- Desktop clients and browser extensions about users' activities (which programs, tabs and for how long user has used it)
- Remote repositories about developers' source code quality metrics


## Dashboard
Gaining insights from the development process has never been easier. [Dashboard](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-47240-5_16)â€™s primary purpose is to share important information in terms of different metrics to the end user.

     * On every push to the main branch LightHouse CI pipline created, on the last step the link like 'Open the report at ...' exist

## Installation
1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start` to boot up a development server
3. Visit the link found in your terminal after running `yarn start`.

## Automated Deploy
### Virtual Machine recommendations
* Platform% Intel Ice Lake
* vCPU 2
* RAM 2 GB
*  Disk space 10 GB

### The process
Here are the steps to deploy those applications on your machine with proper automated deployment

* Install [Dokku](https://dokku.com/docs/getting-started/installation/) on your server machine
* Add the DockerHub credentials to the GitHub secrets
* Create applications and git repos on Dokku:
    ```
    sudo dokku apps:create <appname>
    sudo dokku git:initialize  <appname>
* Change appname in github workflow to the one of your choice.
* Add private ssh key of your machine to github actions secrets using key SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
* Change dokku server ip in repository workflow
* Change docker registry in repository workflow
* Then merge/push to main branch
* Profit.
